# Driver Signatures from Telematic data

Insurance companies now record Telematic data (X,Y coordinates vs Time) for drivers to understand driver behaviour and calculate the premium that the driver must pay for insurance. 

We sourced the data from a Kaggle competition that Axa Telematics had hosted. 

## Motivation 

We were learning Spark and we wanted to take an existing problem and adapt its solution in Spark. We chose to use this competition because the dataset seemed very interesting. This was a dead Kaggle competition and so we actually had access to intelligent solutions, this was important because we wanted to understand best practices and adapt the solution to Spark. 

We used PySpark for the project

## Data 

We had data for about 3500 drivers. For each driver there were 200 files containing telematic data for 200 trips with X,Y coordinates in every line.
